      <p>Welcome! Im sure 90% of you came here for Python learning. Well, good for you! This website is dedicated for those who struggle on Python.</p>
      <p>Python is made by [insert person here] at [insert date here] for [insert reason here]</p>
      <p>The starting Python syntax is usually this: <code>print("Hello world!")</code>. Simple, right?</p>
            <p>Syntaxes on Python is pretty simple, yet, Python itself is slow on executing things.</p>
      <p>You could do usual, simple maths like this: 
        <br>
        <code>a = 90;
          <br>
              b = 10;
          <br>
          print(a + b);</code></p>
        <br>
      <p>Or do string-splicing, like this:
        <br>
        <code>congrats = "Congratulations";
          <br>
          test = "on the test!";
          <br>
          congrats-text = congrats + test;
          <br>
          print(congrats-text);</code></p>
      <p>That will result in <code>"Congratulations on the test!"</code>.</p>
          
        <p>The syntax is real simple, but you gotta be careful with it. You might unexpectedly break the code!</p>
      <p>Theres more information on the next page about Numbers (Maths).</p>
      <p>Remember to <code>print("Stay Determined!");</code></p>

      <p>Hello! And welcome to the Maths section!</p>
      <p>Here, you'll learn all the basics about numbers, and doing maths in Python!</p>
      <p>If you already learned other programming languages, numbers intend to not use quotes (""), because if you do use quotes, you'll get a string instead of a number!</p>
      <p>In programming languages, numbers usually called "Integer". Altough, the normal integer and the decimal-pointed integer is not called an integer, they're called "Double".</p>
      <p>Well, thats enough talking. Lets get to action!
        In the Introduction page, I typed some code to demonstrate the maths in Python. Well, ain't that too easy? Well, we'll learn more about the operators!
        In usual maths in school, you learned these symbols: +, -, x, and :.
        Well, in the computer world, "x" is usually typed into "*", and the ":" into "/". So, it becomes like this: +, -, *, /. I'll give you a code to demonstrate!
        <br>
        <code>cookie = 20;
             <br>
              person = 4;
          <br>
          cookies_per_person = cookie / person;
          <br>
          print(cookies_per_person);
        </code>
        <br>
        As you can see, I used the "/" operator. Pretty simple, right?</p>
        <p>Whats that? You want to know more about the other operators? Great! My hands is tired writing all this non-sense.
          <br>
          Okay, theres more other operators than you might think. Theres <code>++</code>, <code>+=</code>, and much more. (You can just replace the "+" with the other type of basic operators.)
      </p>
      <p>Now, I'll mention the "++" operator.</p>
      <p>The "++" operator is basically the <code>"[number] + 1"</code>. You can use it to count scores more easily.</p>
      <p>And the "+=" operator, almost the same as "++" operator, only you can use numbers other than one and it uses variables on the first one <code>([var] += 19)</code>.</p>
      <p>Welp, I guess thats all I have for Integers and Maths on Python. I'll see you in the next section!</p>
